Software Engineer based in London - I build full stack applications for
the mobile and web.

Experienced with Javascript, React, React Native, GraphQL, Postgres and
AWS.

I'm a wannabe Rust developer (check out [my Spotify project](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pulls))

When I'm not programming, I play music (piano, guitar and lute), go rock
climbing, paint with watercolours and spend time with friends
and family.
