Software Engineer based in London - I build full stack applications for the mobile and web.

Experienced with Javascript, React, React Native, GraphQL, Postgres and AWS.

Author of [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) - a Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust ðŸš€.

I want to be using Rust full time!

When I'm not programming, I play music (piano, guitar and lute), read books, swing kettle bells, go rock climbing, paint with watercolours and spend time with friends and family.
